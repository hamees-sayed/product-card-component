## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

To center a div vertically, this is the best method: 

```css
body {
  margin: 0;  // these two properties should always be in the body element
  padding: 0;
}

.main-div {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;   // change the height accordingly
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'll probably next work to make this site responsive
